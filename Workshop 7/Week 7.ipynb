Because the 16S rRNA gene is conserved across bacterial species, it is a commonly targeted region for amplification and sequencing in microbial ecology studies. The resulting 16S rRNA sequences can then be used to identify different bacterial taxa and analyze microbial communities.\n",

    "### What is sequence distance?\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA sequence distance measures are methods used to quantify the differences between two or more DNA sequences. These measures are important in various fields of research, including molecular biology, bioinformatics, and evolutionary biology. By measuring sequence distance, researchers can gain insights into the evolutionary relationships between organisms, identify genetic mutations that are associated with diseases or other traits, and analyze the structure and function of DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance measure depends on the type of data being analyzed and the specific research question being addressed: here we will use two common distance measures known as **Hamming Distance** and **Levenshtein Distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamming distance is a measure of the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in two sequences are different. It is commonly used in computer science and information theory, and is also relevant in DNA sequencing. The Levenshtein distance, on the other hand, is a measure of the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion, or substitution) required to transform one sequence into another. It is useful for comparing DNA sequences with insertions, deletions, and substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will explore the concepts of Hamming distance and Levenshtein distance, specifically for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. We will learn how to calculate the distance between two sequences using these methods, and understand the significance of the results in the context of species identification. We will also discuss the limitations and applications of these methods in biological research. \n"
